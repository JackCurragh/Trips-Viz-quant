# Trips-Viz-quant
TripsViz with quantification functionality

run __init__.py with python 2 to test this functionality. navigate to 0.0.0.0:5000/ in a browser (if running on a server replace 0.0.0.0 with the server IP).

Request a plot using a gene name rather than transcript name and this version will also return OPM and two TPM values. 

Compared to current Trips-Viz github version set up, this should not require manual set up. 
SCRIPT_LOC is determined with os package in config.py 
Other files are renamed as required
